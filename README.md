# **UFOs**
The UFO Finder webpage and dynamic table provides an  in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, it filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## **How to use the Webpage**
1. Go to https://dennisdelriocarbo.github.io/UFOs/ on your web browser.

2. You can look at the entire table or you can use the filter table which allows you to search by date, city, state, country and shape. You can use one, two or all of the search criteria.

3. In this example we have filtered only by city, typing "el cajon" in the box which will return all of the sightings reported at "el cajon".

5. You can reset the filters by deleting the previous search and see the full table displayed again, and enter new filters for a different search.

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.





Summary:
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.


### **Drawbacks**
One of the drawbacks of this webpage is that you cannot compare sightings between two different search criteria. Maybe you wanted to compare similarities between sightings in two different cities but with the same shape. 

### **Recommendations for further development.**
1. Increase the number of filters to be allowed to filter by duration.
2. Incorporate a filter to search for key words.
3. Allow to compare sightings between two or three different cities or state at the same time.
