# **UFOs**
The UFO Finder webpage and dynamic table provides an  in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, it filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## **How to use the Webpage**
1. Go to https://dennisdelriocarbo.github.io/UFOs/ on your web browser.

2. You can look at the entire table or you can use the filters table which allows you to search by date, city, state, country and shape. You can use one, two or all of the search criteria.

3. In this example we have filtered only by city, typing "el cajon" in the box which will return all of the sightings reported at "el cajon".

4. Next we entered another filter for the shape "light" with the following results:

5. You can reset the filters by deleting the previous search and see the full table displayed again, and enter new filters for a different search.

## **Summary**

### **Drawbacks**
One of the drawbacks of this webpage is that you cannot have a table that displays the results  between two different citeria like two different cities or shapes for exmaple.

### **Recommendations for further development.**
1. Increase the number of filters to be allowed to filter for duration.
2. Incorporate a filter to search for key words.
3. Allow to compare sightings in a table between two or three different cities, shapes or states at the same time.
